## Rogan Ipsum

Rogan Ipsum is a lorem ipsum generator that spits out nonsense text inspired by Joe Rogan's speech patterns. Built with Svelte, it's my own little POC to test Svelte as a framework.

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```
